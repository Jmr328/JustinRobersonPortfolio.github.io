                        Born and raised in Jacksonville, Fl. Most of my youth I spent my time playing sports and running around with my buddies. It wasn't until I got to highschool
                        that I first discovered my interest for web design and developement. I would always be designing webpages for my friends and 
                        editing short videos until, one day, someone offered to contract me for a custom website design, since then I knew this was something I could do.
                        After attending the University of North Florida, I got into a Finance Manager Role which I enjoyed for several years. But I came to the decision of
                        Software Engineering not only because I genuinely enjoyed my time creating web designs, but also, I wanted a career that won't be going out of style anytime soon.
                        I am familiar with HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, React, & JavaScript. But I believe coding is a skill that can be infinitively refined and I am always up for the challenge 
                        of learning a new language!
